# Overview

This challenge focuses on solving a Regex Crossword Puzzle using
algorithmic constraint solving.

A crossword grid must be filled with letters such that:

- Each row satisfies a given regular expression.
- Each column satisfies a given regular expression.

The provided implementation uses:

- Backtracking search
- Regex-based validation
- Incremental constraint checking

The system currently produces a solution but may contain logical flaws
in how constraints are applied or validated.

Participants must analyze the algorithm and improve correctness.
