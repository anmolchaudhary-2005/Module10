# Rules and Constraints

1. The crossword grid is square (N x N).
2. Each cell contains one letter from the allowed alphabet.
3. Each row must satisfy its corresponding regex rule.
4. Each column must satisfy its corresponding regex rule.
5. A valid solution must satisfy ALL regex constraints.

Important:

- Regex constraints must match the entire row or column.
- Partial matches are not sufficient.

Participants may modify:

- Regex validation logic
- Backtracking or pruning strategy
- Constraint checking methods
