# Regex Crossword Solver Challenge (Level 100)

This project implements a regex-based crossword puzzle solver.

Each row and column must satisfy regex constraints.

The solver uses backtracking search.

The program runs successfully but may produce incorrect solutions.

Participants must:

- Analyse constraint validation
- Improve solver correctness
- Ensure all regex constraints are satisfied
